A spefific platform configuration can activate an **editorial versioning and approval workflow**.

When this feature is enabled, if the the **Vendor** makes changes on the editorial 
descriptions of a product / plan, the platform creates a **draft** that needs to be 
approved by the **Admin** in order to become effective (really published on a marketplace).

The Vendor can request the Admin to review (and possibly approve) his draft by clicking 
on a "request review" button.

The platform provides the Admin with a view listing all the "pending drafts". By clicking on
one of them, a *comparison view* is provided, to emphatize the differences between the previous 
contents and their latest versions.

While a draft is under approval by the Admin, the Vendor can still *update* his draft, the new  
modifications will substitute the previous ones on the "current draft".

When the Admin approves a draft:
- the vendor receives a notification ("your draft is now approved")
- if the draft refers to an unpublished plan, the platform automatically publish it
- if the draft refers to _main product descriptions_ (not directly related to plans), 
  the changes are published on the marketplaces only if the prodct was already visible
