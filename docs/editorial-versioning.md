A specific platform configuration can activate an **editorial versioning and
approval workflow**.

When this feature is enabled, if the the **Vendor** makes changes on the
editorial descriptions of a product / plan, the platform creates a **draft**
that needs to be approved by the **Admin** in order to become effective (really
published on a marketplace).

The Vendor can request the Admin to review (and possibly approve) his draft by
clicking on a "request review" button. Once done, the Admin will receive an
**email notification**.

The platform provides the Admin with a view listing all the "pending drafts". By
clicking on one of them, a *comparison view* is provided, to empathize the
differences between the previous contents and their latest versions.

While a draft is under approval by the Admin, the Vendor can still *update* his
draft, the new modifications will substitute the previous ones on the "current
draft".

When the Admin approves a draft:

- the vendor receives an **email notification** ("your draft is now approved")
- if the draft refers to an unpublished plan, the platform automatically publish
  it
- if the draft refers to _main product descriptions_ (not directly related to
  plans), the changes are published on the marketplaces only if the product was
  already visible
