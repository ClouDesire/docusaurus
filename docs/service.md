In this section you will understand how to onboard generic services into the
marketplace catalog.

## What is a Service product

A *Service* is a product that is not tied to the usage of a web application but
to the provisioning of a service to the end-user after paying a certain amount
(e.g.: a consultancy service, formation, support).

## Features

A service can be marked as provisioned:

* manually by the vendor in the subscription page
* via an API integration like a [syndicated product](syndication.md).


## FAQ

* Why creating a specific product for something very similar to a syndicated product?

Software vendors tend to be easily confused with Syndication when they want to
expose a product listing in the marketplace catalog, so we decided to create a
brand new product type with this use-case in mind.

* Are there any differences between a service and a syndicated product?

Actually not, it's just semantic. In the future we may optimize the user
experience for this specific use-case.
