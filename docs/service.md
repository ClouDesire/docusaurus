In this section you will understand how to onboard services into the marketplace
catalog.

A service is a product that is not tied to the usage of a web application but to
the provisioning of a service to the end-user after paying a certain amount
(e.g.: a consultancy service, formation, support).

A service doesn't require an API integration like [syndicated
product](syndication.md) and can be marked as provisioned:

* manually by the vendor in the subscription page
* automatically via the 'Set the subscription state to deployed after the
  purchase' flag in the *Plans* section, *Configurations* tab.
* via an API integration like a [syndicated product](syndication.md).
