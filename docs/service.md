## What is a Service product

A *Service* is a product that is not tied to the usage of a web application but to
the provisioning of a service to the end-user after paying a certain amount
(e.g.: a consultancy service, formation, support).

## Features

A service can be marked as provisioned:

* manually by the vendor in the subscription page
* automatically via the 'Set the subscription state to Deployed after the
  purchase' flag in the *Plans* section, *Configurations* tab.
* via an API integration like a [syndicated product](syndication.md).
