title: Bare Virtual-Machines products onboarding

This section describe how to onboard new products on the marketplace that are
**bare Virtual-Machines** without any software installed on it.

Customers get SSH root access to a dedicated VM and they are responsible for the
management and maintenance of them. For SSH root access **public key
authentication is mandatory** and the customer needs to provide its own public
key before buying a VM product. A new keypair can be automatically generated
during the marketplace checkout process.

ISVs cannot independently create new VM product, but an administrator should
create and assign a product that can be managed by a particular software vendor.
