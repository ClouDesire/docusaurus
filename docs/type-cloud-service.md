Cloud Service is a specialized [product type](onboarding.md) that extends
[syndicated products](syndication.md) functionalities by adding a [cloud
credential](customer-cloud-credentials.md) requirement.

In this scenario, the customers must have a cloud credential already associated
with their account, compatible with the cloud service they want to acquire.

As an example, the [Kubernetes clusters](modules-kubernetes) is an
implementation of a Cloud Service.
