Cloudesire platform enables the selling of [Google Workspace] licenses for
platform owners that are Google Partners.

Product plans are prepaid and are mapped to the actual [standard plans] available
from Google, each one with their [renewal type].

After selecting a plan, the customer is prompted to enter:

* the number of user licenses (seats)
* the admin account email (name@company.com)

After the provisioning, the customer can access the Google Workspace dashboard
to finish configuring email delivery for their own domain and to create user
accounts.
