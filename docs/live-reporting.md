A specific platform module is in charge of collecting, with a configurable 
granularity (e.g. daily), the costs/revenues relating to all the pre-paid and
pay-per-use services sold through the marketplace. 

This allows a **Live Reporting** functionality, which is essential in contexts 
where the Cloudesire platform is not directly used to bill end customers, 
but rather must provide 3rd-party systems (ERP) with "billing instructions".

## Contextualization

The default functioning of Cloudesire is to _staticize_ incomes related to:
- [Syndicated Products](syndication.md)
- [Docker Applications](socker.md)
- [VM products](vm.md)
- AWS/GCE/Azure Tenants
- etc

on a dedicated data-structure, named **proceeds**, which contains:
- _pre-paid_ incomes, that will be staticized at the **beginning** of each 
  billing period of the related subscription
- _post-paid_ (pay-per-use) incomes, that will be staticized at the
  **end** of each billing period of the related subscription
  
 Depending on the billing frequency (monthly, bimonthly, yearly, etc.) of 
 the running subscriptions, Cloudesire aggregates all the _proceeds' rows_ 
 related to each subscription, and periodically generates the related
 **invoices** to be issued to the end-customers.
 
 If the [Distribution and Channel Management](channel.md) module is active,
 the proceeds' rows will be accordingly _markupped_ along the parent-child chain:
 
 - the Parent will markup the _vendor costs_ (previously specified by the Vendors)
   by configuring the _wholesale prices_ for Distributors 
 - the Distributors will markup the _wolesale prices_ (previously specified 
   by the Parent) by configuring the _sell-in prices_ for Resellers
 - the Resellers will markup the _sell-in prices_ (previously specified 
   by the Distributors) by configuring the _sell-out prices_ for end-customers

as a consequence, the invoices' rows will include the sell-out prices.

## Goals

Normally, Cloudesire directly invoices the end-customers, accordingly their 
running subscriptions' billing-cycles. This implies that "every day" a certain number 
of invoices will be automatically generated by the platform.

In some specifc use-cases, the platform owner could not be interested in using the 
Cloudesire Invoicing Engine, for different reasons, like for example:
 - he wants to leverage an external Invoicing Platform
 - he wants to schedule the invoicing - for *all the end-users at the same time*, 
   by following a *custom calendar* (e.g. the first day of each month)

In those scenarios, the platform can be specially configured in order to:
- not directly invoice the end-users
- calculate, for each running subscription, the "proportional daily quota" of 
  their related costs/incomes
- historicize, on a **live-proceeds** data-structure, the raw data
- allows a 3rd-party to retrieve the collected values via API

As a consequence, a typical approach to reach the fulfit the above mentioned
requirement would be to implementat an API integration between the external 
Invoicing Platform and Cloudesire in order to retrieve the *live-proceeds* 
collected in a certain timeframe (e.g. the previous month).

## Functioning

The previously described **live reporting** funcionality provides benefits
for different actors:
- the platfom owner can invoice all the end-customers at the same time,
  regardless their subcriptions lifecycles, by using an external Invoicing 
  Platform
- the end-customers can leverage a **live costs previews** funcionality on 
  their private Dashboards (of course, in this case, the default invoices 
  list fuctionality would be disabled)
