Cloudesire is a cloud applications store that allows software vendors to sell
and distribute their applications as Software-as-a-Service, in few minutes, by
automating several expensive, mission critical and time-consuming tasks.

This section is intended to provide the software vendors updated documentation
about the Cloudesire platform and its easy-onboarding functionality.

  modules, the main concepts and a Glossary. This could be a good starting point
  for your reading!
* [Onboarding of Docker applications](deployed.md): are you interested in
  onboarding and selling your application, self-provisioning it on a new VM for
  each customer?

  integrate and sell your multi-tenant, already running on your cloud and
  SaaS-ready application?
* [Onboarding of Services](service.md): sell your services (e.g. formation,
  consultancy)
* [Onboarding of API service](api-product.md): sell your REST API, with a
  prepaid or pay-per-use pricing model
