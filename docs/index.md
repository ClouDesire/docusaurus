Cloudesire is a SaaS marketplace that allows software vendors to easily sell and
distribute their applications by automating several expensive, mission critical
and time-consuming tasks.

This section is best suited for software vendor to discover the Cloudesire
onboarding functionality.

* [Onboarding overview](onboarding.md): the first steps to create a new product
  into the marketplace, a must read for marketing and sales people.

The platform supports different type of applications and the onboarding steps
are slightly different for each option:

* [Syndicated applications (multi-tenant saas)](syndication.md): this is the
  most common choice, and it's a perfect fit for multi-tenant,
  running on your infrastructure, SaaS-ready services
* [Docker applications](docker.md): you package your application with Docker, we
  self-provision it on a new Virtual Machine for each customer, on every supported cloud
  provider
* [API](api-product.md): we support REST API with a prepaid or pay-per-use
  pricing models
* [Generic Services](service.md): sell your services without an automatic
  workflow (e.g. formation, consultancy)

software vendors but is good to know them:

* [Microsoft CSP](csp-product.md)
