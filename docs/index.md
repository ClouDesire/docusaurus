Cloudesire is a cloud applications store that allows software vendors to sell and distribute their applications as Software-as-a-Service, in few minutes, by automating several expensive, mission critical and time-consuming tasks.

This section is intended to provide the software vendors updated documentation about the Cloudesire platform and its easy-onboarding functionality.

* [Platform overview](momdules.md): a detailed description of the platform modules, the main concepts and a Glossary. This could be a good starting point for your reading!
* [Onboarding of syndicated applications](syndication.md): do you want to integrate and sell your multi-tenant, already running on your cloud and SaaS-ready application? Read this section!
* [Onboarding of cloud applications](deployed.md): are you interested in onboarding and selling your application, self-provisioning it on a new VM for each customer? Read this section, we also support [Docker Packaging](deployed.md#docker-packaging)!
