Cloudesire is a SaaS marketplace platform that allows software vendors to easily
sell and distribute their applications by automating several expensive, mission
critical and time-consuming tasks: catalog management, order processing,
resources provisioning, billing and invoicing.

## New products onboarding

This section is best suited for software vendors that wants to discover the
Cloudesire onboarding functionality.

* [Onboarding overview](onboarding.md): the first steps to create a new product
  into the marketplace, a must read for marketing and sales people.

The platform supports different types of products, and the onboarding steps
are slightly different for each case:

* [Syndicated applications (multi-tenant saas)](syndication.md): this is the
  most common choice, and it's a perfect fit for multi-tenant,
  running on your infrastructure, SaaS-ready services
* [Docker applications](docker.md): you package your application with Docker, we
  self-provision it on a new Virtual Machine for each customer, on every
  supported cloud provider
* [API](api-product.md): we support REST API with a prepaid or pay-per-use
  billing model
* [Generic Services](service.md): sell your services without an automatic
  workflow (e.g. formation, consultancy)

We supports additional product types that can't be directly published by
software vendors (but assigned from platform administrators):

* [Microsoft CSP](csp-product.md)
* [Bare VM](vm.md)
* [OpenStack tenants](openstack.md)
