title: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Marketplace Compliance
sidebar_label: GDPR-compliance
---

The most significant piece of European data protection legislation to be
introduced in 20 years will begin to be enforced on 25 May 2018. The EU General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces the 1995 EU Data Protection
Directive. The GDPR strengthens the rights that individuals have regarding
personal data relating to them and want to unify data protection laws across
Europe, regardless of where that data is processed.

As Cloudesire we are committed to GDPR compliance for every marketplace we
manage, even for non-european customers.
