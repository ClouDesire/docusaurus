I had the possibility to speech at the Container Day 2018 in Verona, presenting
the open source Traefik project, a load balancer that helps in exposing web services
on container-based infrastructures.

Traefik is going to replace the nginx-based frontends of the current Cloudesire
infrastructure to decrease burden of deploying new services.
